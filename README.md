# Machine Learning Projects
This page collects some Machine Learning (ML) projects on which I have been working recently. These projects originated from the Data Science in Python course that I have been following on DataQuest. Information about the data used and project descriptions are contained in the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository is work in progress and the projects themselves might undergo some changes over time. For the moment, there are three projects in the repository:

## 1. Predicting car prices
In this project, we use the **k-nearest neighbors algorithm** to predict a car's market price using its attributes. We explore some basic *data cleaning* techniques, *univariate* and *multivariate model*, and *hyperparameter tuning*.

## 2. Predicting house sale prices
In this project, we use **linear regression** to predict house sale prices in Ames, Iowa. We explore *feature engineering*, *feature selection*, and some *validation techniques*: simple train/test validation, holdout validation, and k-fold cross validation.

## 3. Building a handwritten digits classifier
In this project, we use a **deep, feedforward neural network** to classify handwritten digits. We compare the results obtained with a k-nearest neighbors algorithm. We explore how the number of neurons and the number of hidden layers impact on the accuracy scores, and use some validation techniques to quantitatively evaluate *overfitting*.
