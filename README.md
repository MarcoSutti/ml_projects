# Machine Learning Projects
This page collects some Machine Learning (ML) projects I have been recently working on. These projects originated from the *Data Science in Python* course that I have been following on *Dataquest*. Information about the data used and project descriptions are contained in the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository is **work in progress** and the projects themselves might undergo some changes over time. For the moment, there are **five projects** in the repository:

## 1. Predicting car prices
We use the **k-nearest neighbors algorithm** to predict a car's market price using its attributes. We explore some basic *data cleaning* techniques, *univariate* and *multivariate model*, and *hyperparameter tuning*.

## 2. Predicting house sale prices
We use **linear regression** to predict house sale prices in Ames, Iowa. We explore *feature engineering*, *feature selection*, and some *validation techniques*: simple train/test validation, holdout validation, and k-fold cross validation.

## 3. Building a handwritten digits classifier
We use a **deep, feedforward neural network** to classify handwritten digits. We compare the results obtained with a k-nearest neighbors algorithm. We explore how the number of neurons and the number of hidden layers impact on the accuracy scores, and use some validation techniques to quantitatively evaluate *overfitting*.

## 4. Predicting bike rentals
We try to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. To accomplish this, we create a few different machine learning models (**linear regression**, **decision trees**, and **random forests**), and evaluate their performance.

## 5. Predicting the stock market
We use pandas' time series tools to generate new indicators and then we train a **linear regression** model to make predictions about the future prices of the S&P500 Index.
